# conan-make-netbeans-integration

This project aims at a use-case for integrating conan c++ package dependency management into an existing tool chain; in this case a Netbeansproject. A small hello-world mpi code is used to integrate the openmpi library built as conan package. The hello world code was written in Netbeans, with the automatically generated Makefile structure.
